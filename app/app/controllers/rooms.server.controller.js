/**
	This is the controller that controls all the functionality of the room
	This controller allows users to add, delete, modify a room offer. This is also 
	the controller that allows users to view the room. So in short this controller
	is the room manager.
	
	Note this file might be renamed as 'offers.server.controller'. This is because 
	this is technically the offer. This is yet to be planned
