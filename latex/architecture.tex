\chapter{Project Design}

In this chapter we list the functional requirements of the application with some rudimentary explanations. Using UML(Unified Modeling Language) to identify the users of the application, show possible use cases. Describe the architecture of the application as well as give a layout of the database design and what protocols will be used and why.
\section{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item registration clients
\item enable user logging in and logging out 
\item client offer management - add, edit and remove an offer for a house rental
\item user management - list registered clients and their personal details, revoke users, add users administratively 
\item search function - search offer by set of criteria such as location, price availability 
\item basic booking management - Allow landlords to view forthcoming reservations, confirm clients stay as well as allow clients to make bookings and view forth coming bookings
\item rating mechanism - allow users to rate an offer based on a list of criteria as well as allow landlords to rate their clients stay. The rating system should mitigate discrimination.
\item basic content management - add, edit and delete content of offers i.e photos
\item create easy to use application programming interface(API)- API would allow users to access the service via front-ends other than a web browser i.e Smartphone app
\end{itemize}
