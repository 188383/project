\chapter{Project Design}

In this section we demonstrate, using Unified Modeling Language(UML) notation, the conceptual model using  ''use cases'' diagrams(taking the functional requirements into account), The architecture of the System and database design using Class Diagrams and  Sequence Diagrams between key processes.(list and expand on the functional requirements there where necessary)
\section{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item registration of admin and clients
\item enable logging in and logging out 
\item allow users(both admin and clients) to view dashboard
\item allow clients to add/revoke a rental offer
