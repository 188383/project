\section{Aim}
The aim of this thesis is to design and develop a prototype for a web based service that will allow registered users to advertise short term room rentals as well as browse a common list of rooms on offer. The service will offer a limited administration panel for the users. This admin service will enable users to track their bookings, allow home owners to manage client bookings as well as offer all clients an opportunity to rate a room that has been visited as well as for home owners to rate the stay of their respective clients

(here we need to expand on the introduction and explain in concrete terms, what it is that we are trying to develop as well as discuss the chapters that follow. The discussion of the chapters should be brief and to the point, followed by introductions to each chapter. Another useful thing to add would be a word list that will help eliminate some confusion)
