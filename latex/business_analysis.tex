\section{Problem}
Home owners who are in possession of excess floor space in the form of unused rooms or annexes to their homes) could capitalize on the major increase in human traffic across all the borders of the European Union as well as internally of each country in Europe by offering these travelers short term accommodation at a "reasonable" or suitable rate for both the traveler and the owner. The problem for such home owners is the extra overhead costs spent in advertising costs and/or other third parties(from here on referred to as "third parties") that help facilitate these transfers. Sometimes the costs are too large for smaller owners to handle and thus they lose their share of the market as well as their share of the total revenue spent on accommodation by the above mentioned traveler.\\
In the same way the European traveler who is experiencing a squeeze in income is looking for cheaper accommodation and yet keeping the same or similar standard of accommodation as previously when spending was not so limited. 

\section{Existing Solutions}
There is a range of solutions available for the home owner to make use of. An example(and by far one of the most popular websites) of an existing solution is Airbnb(http://airbnb.com), which offers users an opportunity to rent out a house from a third party as well as many other options. A popular site in Poland is booking.pl(http://booking.pl) which allows users to search for accommodation around the world. 

These existing solutions don't offer one group of users, that is the owners of homes, a way to comment the stay of their clients and thus enabling other home owners a chance to mitigate unwanted customers(i.e destructive, not following policy etc) but at the same time limit unwarranted discrimination of these same customers. The existing solutions don't offer the client an opportunity to swap his/her reservation with another client for what ever reason but rather penalty fees are charged so as to discourage such behavior.
